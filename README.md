## Quick Publish Options

### GitHub Pages (easiest, free)
1) Create a new public repo on GitHub named `echo-playbook`.
2) Upload **index.html** and **cover.png** to the repo root (or drag & drop).
3) Go to **Settings → Pages**.
4) Under **Build and deployment → Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
5) Set **Branch** to `main` (or `master`) and **/ (root)**, then **Save**.
6) Wait ~1 min. Your site will be live at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/echo-playbook/`

### Netlify (drag‑drop)
1) Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2) Drag the **zip** you downloaded below onto the page.
3) Netlify will give you a live URL immediately.

### Any host
Just upload both files to the same folder. The page uses Tailwind via CDN, so no build step is required.
